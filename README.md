# Yelp-Restaurant-Project

## What Each File Means

In this github, you'll find the entirerty of our project. The files that aren't sorted into the first two folders are pieces of code we used for the later parts of the project. "City Heatmaps" was test code for what we could do with the heatmaps, while "Yelp API Projct" was test code for us making API calls. 

Our presentation can also be seen on this main screen in "To Hibachi or Not to Hibachi.pptx". 

## What should I expect in each folder?

There are two folders: "Restaurant Competitors" and "yelpProject." 

In "Restaurant Competitors," you'll find all of the code and analysis we had used to analyze our client's figurative direct competitors. The "yelpProject" on the other hand is all the code and data we used to analyze our nearby competitors.

In these folders, you will also find the code we used to create our graphs and collect our data. "yelpProject" used a different way to obtain and organize its data compared to "Restaurant Competitors." The code for the heatmaps can also be found in "Restaurant Competitors." 

## What should I be looking at?

In "Restaurant Competitors," you will find the following files:
* "Restaurant Competition -Copy1.pynb" - This file will have all the code relating to the non-heatmap graphs and data regarding the restaurant's direct competitors. 
* "All Restaurant Heatmaps.ipynb." - This file will have all the code relating to the heatmaps showing all of our restaurant's competitors instead of just its direct competitors. 
* "Competitors Heatmaps.ipynb" - This file will have all the code relating to the heatmaps showing all of our direct competitors. 
* "Review Count Heatmap Competitors.ipynb" - Shows the heatmaps for our direct competitors, except thew eight is based on review count instead of rating.
