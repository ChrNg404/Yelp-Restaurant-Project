# Yelp-Restaurant-Project

## What Each File Means

In this github, you'll find the entirerty of our project. The files that aren't sorted into the first two folders are pieces of code we used for the later parts of the project. "City Heatmaps" was test code for what we could do with the heatmaps, while "Yelp API Projct" was test code for us making API calls. 

Our presentation can also be seen on this main screen in "To Hibachi or Not to Hibachi.pptx". 

## The Files in Folders

There are two folders: "Restaurant Competitors" and "yelpProject." 

In "Restaurant Competitors," you'll find all of the code and analysis we had used to analyze our client's figurative direct competitors. THe yelpProject on the other hand is all the code and data we had used to analyze our nearby competitors.

In these folders, you will also find the code we used to create our graphs and collect our data. "yelpProject" used a different way to obtain and organize its data compared to "Restaurant Competitors." The code for the heatmaps can also be found in "Restaurant Competitors."
